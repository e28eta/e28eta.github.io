<!-- todo: add picture of llamas (with Jatoba?) -->

intro, including tl;dr summary of what's in here?

hackathons
compare/contrast Stripe vs Intuit
how much work can you get done in X hours to do something meaningful
why isn't it on regular roadmap
presentation matters: being accurate but also explaining why it's important / interesting
judging criteria hidden?

H4
push notifications on unrecognized login
to a device we do recognize
alert user
I'm not sure why this wasn't regular roadmap. But it was appropriately sized, and the
hackathon was a good place for people from the security & ios team to team up and get it done


h5
terminal team
interest in black-box hardware peripheral and SDK
Bt sniffing
swizzle / objc runtime tricks
I thought it had potential: internal dev testing. external dev testing. end user testing & training
with Stripe Issuing, maybe this is even more true?

h6
boba shop
dogfooding terminal, and letting other Stripe ee's use a stripe business
spent time on it after hackathon, fleshing it out. Don't remember what was the MVP, but
do remember the final results
