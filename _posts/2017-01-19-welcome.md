Here's the stereotypical "Welcome to my blog" post. My name is Daniel Jackson, and I'm a software engineer. I went to Cal Poly, and I've worked at CDM Technologies, Amazon, Apple, and Intuit.

Now that's out of the way, why am I blogging? I don't think I'll be a particularly interesting writer. Instead, for several years I've been compiling a small list of programming problems encountered and (mostly) solved that I wish I had found answered on the Internet. It remains to be seen if I'll manage to write about them before they're obsolete.

Essentially this is going to be my place to put things I wish someone else had written. I've mostly worked on iOS applications, so that'll probably be my main focus.

I'll be surprised if I *don't* abandon this blog for weeks or months at a time.
