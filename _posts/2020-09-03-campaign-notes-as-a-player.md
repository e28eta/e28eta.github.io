I recently started playing D&D again, after a *long* hiatus. I got very excited about it and wanted to take robust notes, but didnâ€™t know how to best approach it. Iâ€™m currently trying two things: a narrative journal of our sessions, and an encyclopedia of everything notable from those sessions. I did a broad search of campaign note software, and found a variety of suitable looking stuff, albeit mostly targeted at the Dungeon Master.

Itâ€™s an interesting challenge trying to find software when you donâ€™t know what itâ€™s called. Even more so when I didnâ€™t know which features would be most important to me. I found a bunch of candidates, but I feel really fortunate that I stumbled onto [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) software, specifically [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md).

# Obsidian

> Obsidian is a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.
> In Obsidian, making and following [[connections]] is frictionless.

"Powerful knowledge base" and "frictionless" are very general claims. What do they mean, and how accurate is it?

I believed I was looking for personal wiki software. I wanted to create a set of pages, and interconnect them. I also wanted to be able to put them into hierarchies. Iâ€™m also somewhat spoiled by the editing experience of IDEs. Obsidian delivers, and itâ€™s free.

* Links: it is easy to build a wiki-like encyclopedia with many inter-page links, and navigating links during editing is just a cmd-click
* Creating/editing pages *is* easy: files are auto-created if needed, and unlike a typical web-based experience thereâ€™s no edit/save cycle.
* Markdown formatting makes for simple formatting, and the editor does what I expect. For example, surrounding selected text with formatting characters, instead of replacing the selected content.
* Quick navigation: open files by names
	* Bonus points that this supports the type of matching Iâ€™m used to from Xcode. Matches all files that contain the characters entered in the order they were entered, with any insertions allowed.
* Auto-completion of links. The app knows the name/path of every `md` file and will use that for an auto-completion list when creating a link (same as open by name)
	* It **also** updates links to a file when it is renamed inside the app
* Uses markdown files in folders
	* I can build my own hierarchy, and the auto-updating of links means I can evolve the hierarchy as needed.
	* Makes it easy to version control & share via git. Even for a personal project, I like a version history & the ability to leave myself commit messages.
* Images shown in preview mode. I donâ€™t have many images (yet?), but itâ€™s nice for maps
* I haven't made much use of tags yet, but they look useful as I want to create additional connections/correlations between entries.

It does have some problems, but so far theyâ€™re minor annoyances. Like the fact itâ€™s cross-platform software, and doesnâ€™t get everything right for Mac software ðŸ˜¢. Or the fact that I find the multiple editor panes annoying to control & difficult to achieve what I want with them.

Iâ€™ve done some file editing via [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) on iPad. I **did** miss features like auto-completion of links and renaming support, but itâ€™s workable.

# Other Approaches

Without good linking & navigation support, I might prefer fewer documents. Instead of very granular articles, Iâ€™d be tempted to co-locate a lot of information, making it easier to read/browse and use `Find` within the document.

Another approach is a structured database. Define different entity types, and required/supported fields for each. I think this is more likely to be useful for a DM. As a player, I know very little about each new thing, but as the game progresses Iâ€™ll learn more. Compare that to the DM, who might want to (for example) be able to see all the priests of a various deity, and gets a lot of value out of structured data.

Native vs web. Iâ€™m transcribing a sessionâ€™s worth of notes at a time. This means a large batch of changes across the whole encyclopedia at once, and reducing friction is important. I think itâ€™ll be nice to see all those changes together, instead of just versioned changes to each entity. It feels very natural for this to be a native app. As a developer, Iâ€™m very familiar with git, and so are most of the other people I play with. This started as a personal project, but if I share it with the rest of the group I may end up regretting excluding our non-technical party member (or Iâ€™ll need to figure out some way to make it accessible to them).

Using github gives me authn/authz for free, as well as great uptime and sharing. But thereâ€™s no way it scales. If I had multiple editors, conflicts would be a PITA. Plus the huge barrier to entry that git has.

I haven't spent much time evaluating other Zettelkasten software (like Roam), but I suspect they'd meet my needs similarly. I like that Obsidian is free and I control the storage/syncing of the data store, so I probably won't be looking for a replacement anytime soon.
